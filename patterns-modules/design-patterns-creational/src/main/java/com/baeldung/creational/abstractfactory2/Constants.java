    public static final String MESOZOIC_ANIMAL_DESCRIPTION = "The Mesozoic Era, spanning from about 252 million to 66 million years ago, was characterized by the dominance of reptiles and the evolution of early dinosaurs. During the Triassic period, the first dinosaurs, crocodiles, and mammals appeared. The Jurassic period saw the rise of large herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, as well as the first birds. In the Cretaceous period, diverse dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops thrived, along with flying reptiles called pterosaurs.";
    public static final String CENOZOIC_ANIMAL_DESCRIPTION = "The Cenozoic Era, spanning from 66 million years ago to the present, saw the rise of diverse and iconic animals. During the Paleogene period, early mammals, primitive primates, and large herbivores emerged. The Neogene period featured advanced carnivores, hominoids, and evolving horses. In the Quaternary period, Pleistocene ice ages brought megafauna like mammoths and saber-toothed cats, alongside the emergence of modern humans. The Cenozoic Era shaped the animal kingdom, leading to the diverse species we recognize today.";
